# 🌟 Displaying ASCII Characters in C++
This program demonstrates how to display ASCII characters in C++ using character literals and their corresponding decimal values.

## 📝 Program Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
// http://www.asciitable.com/
using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
    cout << (char)65 << endl;
    cout << (char)66 << endl;
    cout << (char)0 << endl;
    cout << (char)1 << endl;
    cout << (char)2 << endl;
    cout << (char)3 << endl;
    cout << (char)4 << endl;
    cout << (char)5 << endl;
    cout << (char)6 << endl;
    cout << (char)7 << endl;
    cout << (char)8 << endl;
    cout << (char)9 << endl;
    cout << (char)10 << endl;
    cout << (char)11 << endl;
    cout << (char)12 << endl;
    cout << "--------------------" << endl;
    cout << (int)'\n' << endl;
    cout << (int)'\a' << endl;
    
    cout << "The digit 5 corresponds to the character " << (int)'5' << endl;
 
    system("pause");   
    return 0;
}
```

# 🧐 Explanation of the Code

## 📚 Including the Libraries
- `#include <iostream>`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line includes the iostream library.
  - 📈 Why it's important? iostream is essential for C++ input and output operations.
- `// http://www.asciitable.com/`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This is a comment providing a link to an ASCII table website. It doesn't impact the code's functionality but serves as a reference.

## 🚀 Main Function
- `int main(void)`:
  - 🔍 What is it? Defines the main function of the program.
  - 📈 Why it's important? In C++, program execution starts with the main function.

## 💡 Displaying ASCII Characters
- `cout << (char)65 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 65 (letter 'A').
- `cout << (char)66 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 66 (letter 'B').
- `cout << (char)0 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 0 (null character).
- `cout << (char)1 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 1 (start of heading).
- `cout << (char)2 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 2 (start of text).
- `cout << (char)3 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 3 (end of text).
- `cout << (char)4 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 4 (end of transmission).
- `cout << (char)5 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 5 (enquiry).
- `cout << (char)6 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 6 (acknowledge).
- `cout << (char)7 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 7 (bell).
- `cout << (char)8 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 8 (backspace).
- `cout << (char)9 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 9 (tab).
- `cout << (char)10 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 10 (line feed).
- `cout << (char)11 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 11 (vertical tab).
- `cout << (char)12 << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the ASCII character corresponding to the decimal value 12 (form feed).
- `cout << "--------------------" << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line adds a separator for clarity.
- `cout << (int)'\n' << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the decimal value of the newline character ('\n').
- `cout << (int)'\a' << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the decimal value of the bell character ('\a').
- `cout << "To 5 san xaraktiras antistixei sto " << (int)'5' << endl;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? This line displays the decimal value of the character '5'.

🛑 System Pause
- `system("pause");`:
  - 🔍 What is it? Pauses the program execution.
  - 📈 Why it's important? Allows the user to see the output before the console window closes. Note: This is Windows-specific and not recommended for portability.

✅ Return Statement
- `return 0;`:
  - 🔍 What is it? The last line of the main function.
  - 📈 Why it's important? Returning 0 signifies successful execution.
