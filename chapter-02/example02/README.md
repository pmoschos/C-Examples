# 🌟 Outputting Values in C++

This program demonstrates how to output the value of a variable in C++ using the `cout` statement.

## 📝 Program Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
    int x = 2;
    
    // Output the value of x using cout
    cout << "The value of x is\t\t" << x << endl;
    cout << "The value of x is \n\n" << x << "\n";
    
    // Pause the program execution
    system("pause");
    
    return 0;
}
```

# 🧐 Explanation of the Code

## 📚 Including the Libraries
- `#include <iostream>`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** This line includes the iostream library.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** iostream is essential for C++ input and output operations.

## 🚀 Main Function
- `int main() { ... }`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Defines the main function of the program.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** In C++, program execution starts with the main function.

## 💡 Outputting Values with cout
- `int x = 2;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** This line declares an integer variable x and initializes it with the value 2.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** It sets the initial value of x.

- `cout << "The value of x is\t\t" << x << endl;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** This line uses cout to output the value of x with a tab character and a new line.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** It demonstrates how to display the value of a variable using cout.

- `cout << "The value of x is \n\n" << x << "\n";`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** This line uses cout to output the value of x with multiple new lines.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** It shows how to format the output with line breaks.

## 🛑 System Pause
- `system("pause");`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Pauses the program execution.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** Allows the user to see the output before the console window closes. Note: This is Windows-specific and not recommended for portability.

## ✅ Return Statement
- `return 0;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** The last line of the main function.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** Returning 0 signifies successful execution.
